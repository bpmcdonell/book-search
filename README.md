# Book Search

## Description
This is a projects that uses mongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node to lookup and save books through the Google Books API. This app pulls the book title, description, author, image, and link for each of the books corresponding to the seach and displays that information on the page. From there, you can add a book from that selection to your "saved books" in your profile.

The goal of this project was to migrate the source code from using a RESTful API to use a GraphQL API with an Apollo Server.

## Installation
First open GitBash and cd to this projects root directory. Then type in ```npm i``` to install the depenancies for the root. Then type in ```npm run install``` to install all the other dependancies. 
Then you can type in ```npm run start``` to start the server and in another GitBash Terminal, ```cd``` to the client folder and type in ```npm run start``` to start the client side. From there the app will start.
